2. Calculation of area of a circle (radius entered by user)
3. Swapping two numbers (with and without a third variable)
4. Finding the factorial of a number
5. Printing the Fibonacci series of 'n' elements and the sum of the series
6. Simple calculator
7. Accepting a file name with starting and ending line numbers as arguments and displaying all lines between the given line numbers
8. Deleting all lines containing a specified word
9. Displaying a list of all files in the current directory
